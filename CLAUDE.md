# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`fits` is a Rust library to **read and write FITS** (Flexible Image Transport
System) files — the standard data format of astronomy. The two non-negotiable
goals shape every decision:

1. **Blazing fast** — zero-copy where the format allows, SIMD bulk byte-swap /
   scaling, parallel-friendly decode, lazy HDU access via seeking.
2. **Whole-standard coverage** — the full **FITS 4.0** standard (images, ASCII
   tables, binary tables with heap/variable-length arrays, random groups for
   read, WCS, time coordinates, tiled compression).

The structural spine is built and tested: the 2880-byte block layer, an ordered
header model (with `CONTINUE` long-string read/write), HDU classification and
boundary sizing, a lazy seeking reader, and a header / raw-data-unit writer. The
core crate is dependency-free by default (the `compression` feature pulls in
`flate2`). Typed image read/write is done (decode/encode +
`BSCALE`/`BZERO`). Binary and ASCII tables read and write; multi-HDU files
(primary + `IMAGE`/`TABLE`/`BINTABLE` extensions) write; binary-table `P`/`Q` heap
arrays and per-column `TSCAL`/`TZERO` decode; random groups read; `CONTINUE`,
`HIERARCH`, and `CHECKSUM`/`DATASUM` (verify + write) are supported. WCS, time
coordinates are not yet typed. Tiled **image and table** compression work behind
the `compression` feature: all five image codecs (`GZIP_1`, `GZIP_2`, `RICE_1`,
`PLIO_1`, `HCOMPRESS_1` with `SMOOTH=1` decode), quantized-float read+write
(`NO_DITHER`/`SUBTRACTIVE_DITHER_1`/`SUBTRACTIVE_DITHER_2`, `ZBLANK`/NaN), and §10.3
fixed-width table compression. WCS and time remain — the
module map below shows what is built versus planned, and
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) tracks the path to feature-complete. The design principles there remain the spec; follow them when
filling the scaffolds in.

## Commands

```bash
cargo build                      # debug build
cargo build --release            # optimized — benchmark against this, never debug
cargo test                       # run all tests
cargo test <name>                # run tests matching a substring
cargo test --lib module::tests   # run one module's tests
cargo bench                      # run benchmarks (once criterion benches exist)
cargo doc --open                 # render API docs
```

Before confirming any change is done, run the full gate (per global rules):

```bash
cargo test && cargo fmt --all && cargo check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
# also exercise the optional codecs:
cargo test --features compression && cargo clippy --all-targets --features compression -- -D warnings
```

## The FITS format in one screen

Read this before touching parsing/writing code; the full reference lives in
[`docs/refs/`](docs/refs/) (curated markdown) with the normative PDF at
`docs/refs/fits_standard40.pdf`.

- A file is a sequence of **HDUs** (Header/Data Units). HDU 0 is the **primary**
  (`SIMPLE = T`); the rest are **extensions** (`XTENSION = 'IMAGE'|'TABLE'|'BINTABLE'`).
- Everything is laid out on a **2880-byte block** grid (= 36 × 80-byte records).
  Header and data units are each padded up to a block multiple (headers with
  spaces; data with NULs, except ASCII-table data padded with spaces).
- A **header** is 80-byte ASCII keyword records (`KEYWORD = value / comment`),
  ending in `END`.
- **Data** is big-endian. `BITPIX` ∈ {8, 16, 32, 64, −32, −64} sets element type
  (8 = unsigned byte; 16/32/64 = signed two's-complement; ±32/±64 = IEEE float).
- Physical value = `BZERO + BSCALE × stored`. Unsigned ints are faked via a
  `BZERO`/`TZERO` offset of `2^(n-1)` with scale 1 — detect and expose as `uN`.
- **Binary tables** carry typed, optionally array-valued columns (`TFORMn`
  codes `LXBIJKAEDCMPQ`) plus a **heap** for variable-length arrays (`P`/`Q`).

## Architecture

The format's structure maps cleanly onto modules. Keep layers separate so the
hot decode path stays lean and optional semantics (WCS, compression) are opt-in.

`lib.rs` is the only place that defines the public surface (`pub use`). Card
rendering is free-format today, so header round-trips reproduce the *model*
exactly but not yet the original byte layout.

Design principles specific to this crate:

- **Two value planes everywhere: raw and physical.** Expose zero-copy raw access
  (typed slice over the source buffer) for the common `scale==1, zero==0,
  endianness-matches-host` case; decode into an owned buffer only when scaling or
  byte-swapping is actually required. Never force callers through float scaling
  they didn't ask for.
- **Lazy by default.** HDU boundaries are computable from headers alone
  (`|BITPIX|·GCOUNT·(PCOUNT + Π NAXISn)` rounded to a block) — never read data to
  find the next HDU. Support `Read + Seek` and memory-mapped sources.
- **Headers round-trip exactly.** Model a header as an *ordered list* of records
  with a side index for lookup — not a hash map. Duplicate `COMMENT`/`HISTORY`
  and record order are significant and must be preserved byte-for-byte.
- **SIMD/parallel the bulk ops.** Endian swap + `BSCALE/BZERO` (and per-column
  `TSCAL/TZERO`) are embarrassingly parallel; tile images and table columns for
  multi-threaded decode. Gate threading behind a feature, keep a scalar fallback.
- **Feature-flag the heavy layers.** Core read/write of images+tables stays
  dependency-light; put WCS math and tiled compression (`RICE_1`, `GZIP`,
  `HCOMPRESS`, `PLIO`) behind features so the base crate is small.
- **"Once FITS, always FITS."** The format never breaks backward compatibility.
  Keep reading legacy structures (random groups, `SIMPLE = F`) forever; just
  don't *write* deprecated forms.

## Correctness expectations

FITS is full of fiddly invariants that silent bugs hide in — test them explicitly
(this is also mandated by the global Rust rules):

- Block padding: assert every written unit is a 2880 multiple, padded with the
  correct fill byte (space for headers/ASCII-table data, NUL for other data).
- Round-trip: parse→write→parse must reproduce headers byte-for-byte and data
  bit-for-bit (including float NaN/Inf, `BLANK`, unsigned offsets).
- Cross-check decoders against known-good files (CFITSIO/astropy outputs) and
  against hand-computed values for small fixtures — never `result < N` assertions.
- Boundary cases: `NAXIS = 0` (no data), zero-length axes, `TFORM` repeat count 0,
  empty heap, `PCOUNT = 0`, maximum 999 columns/axes.

## Conventions registry

Real files lean on a few near-ubiquitous conventions — `CONTINUE` long strings
(now normative, §4.2.1.2), `CHECKSUM`/`DATASUM` integrity keywords (§4.4.2.7 +
Appendix J), and the registered `HIERARCH` long-keyword convention. These are
covered in `docs/refs/08-conventions.md`; the full registry (Green Bank,
inheritance, ESO, …) is at <https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_registry.html>.
Support the in-standard ones first and treat purely-registered ones as optional,
feature-flagged layers. `CONTINUE` long strings are implemented (read and
write); `CHECKSUM`/`DATASUM` and `HIERARCH` are not yet — a `HIERARCH` card
currently falls back to a commentary record so the file stays readable.
