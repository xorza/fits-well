# FITS Standard — Reference Notes

Curated, implementation-focused notes on the **FITS** (Flexible Image Transport
System) standard, distilled from the authoritative sources for building this
library. The canonical normative document is included verbatim as a PDF; the
markdown files are working references that paraphrase and tabulate it for quick
lookup while coding.

> These notes are **non-normative**. When in doubt, the PDF (`fits_standard40.pdf`)
> and the official text at <https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_standard.html> win.

## Maintenance

The standard is governed by the **IAU FITS Working Group (IAUFWG)**. FITS 4.0 was
approved July 2016, language-edited version ratified 13 Aug 2018. A core promise of
FITS is **"once FITS, always FITS"** — the format is append-only and never breaks
backward compatibility with previously valid files. Implementations must keep reading
older structures (e.g. random groups) indefinitely.
